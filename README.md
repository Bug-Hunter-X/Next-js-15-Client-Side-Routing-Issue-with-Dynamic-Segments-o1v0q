# Next.js 15 Client-Side Routing Issue with Dynamic Segments

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug encountered in Next.js 15 related to client-side navigation and links containing dynamic segments. The issue manifests as unexpected behavior when navigating between pages with such links.

## Problem Description

The provided `bug.js` file shows a simple component with links to `/` and `/about` pages.  When using these links for navigation, inconsistent behavior is observed in certain scenarios, specifically when client-side routing is involved.  The root cause lies in how Next.js handles route matching and client-side navigation in the presence of dynamic segments within links.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to the routing issue.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Observe the behavior when clicking the navigation links. Inconsistent behavior may manifest, especially when testing with different browser or network conditions.

## Additional Notes

This issue highlights the importance of thorough testing of navigation behavior when developing Next.js applications that use dynamic routing.  The proposed solution demonstrates how to implement more robust navigation logic to address the observed problems.
